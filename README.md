# Supernovae Type Ia data

This repo contains the SN Ia data of the Pantheon sample (based on Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey observations, [arXiv:1710.00845](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00845)), the JLA sample (based on data from the SDSS-II and SNLS collaborations, [arXiv:1401.4064](https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4064), and the Union3 data files [arXiv:2311.12098](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12098).

Based on the corresponding data files distributed with [CosmoMC](https://github.com/cmbant/CosmoMC). Original Pantheon data files are at [github.com/dscolnic/Pantheon](https://github.com/dscolnic/Pantheon).
