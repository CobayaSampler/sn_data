This repo contains the SN Ia data of the Pantheon sample (based on Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey observations, [arXiv:1710.00845](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00845)) and the JLA sample (based on data from the SDSS-II and SNLS collaborations, [arXiv:1401.4064](https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4064))

These files were originally distributed with [CosmoMC](https://github.com/cmbant/CosmoMC).
